# LKW

For years I worked as a professional driver in Europe,... until I got to know the magical world of programming ...
then I created the first console program that calculated an unnecessarily complicated payment system in my company ...
now, after changing my profession, I make simple apps for friends who still live on the road..
And this wants it to be a collection of saved and new projects..

Next-one is an application that facilitates the calculation of the driver's working time.
Thank you and please use and modify whatever you want..
(I'm new to git, I may not be aware of all possibilities or rules in advance ... sorry ..; p) 

Btw. . My recent apps are already written in Polish(as Iam and majority of drivers in Europe)
